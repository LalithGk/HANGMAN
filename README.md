# Hangman Game 🎮

Welcome to the **Hangman Game**! This is a simple word-guessing game implemented in Python, where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen word letter by letter.

## 🔥 Features
- Randomly selects a name from a predefined list
- Displays blanks for unguessed letters
- Allows players to guess letters until they complete the word
- Notifies the player upon winning

## 🚀 How to Play
1. Run the Python script.
2. The game will randomly select a name and display underscores for each letter.
3. Enter one letter at a time as your guess.
4. If your guess is correct, the letter will be revealed in the word.
5. Keep guessing until you complete the word!
6. The game ends when you successfully guess all the letters.

## 📜 Code Overview
The game logic follows these steps:
- Selects a random word from the list.
- Displays underscores representing unguessed letters.
- Takes input from the player for letter guesses.
- Checks if the guessed letter is in the word and updates the display.
- Repeats until the word is fully revealed.

## 🛠 Prerequisites
